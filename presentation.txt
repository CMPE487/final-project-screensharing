1- CMPE487 Final Project, Screen Sharing, Enes Kosar Onur Kalinagac
2- Introduction
    The reason why we have chosen this project is that we can combine couple of principles for one project.
    We have used, UDP, zeroconf, file transfer protocols within the project.
3- Project Plan
    Checklist of what we have done and when we have done.
4- Obstacles
    The main problem of the project was getting the screenshot. We have tried to use the PILLOW library but it was so slow and then switched to mss.
    The second thing is throughput of the network. We have decreased the resolution of the picture and sent it. This provided us x2 FPS.
5- Flow of the program
    Firstly, server is starting and waiting for a client(s).
    To create a video we have taken screenshots continuously. The reason why we have used UDP is we don't need the whole data. Missing frames are trivial.
    In client we are opening a window with pygame library and drawing each screenshot continuously.
